/// <para>These boxes filter against their own text, and once something is selected that text is the

/// of the one already chosen — and if it answers honestly, the list collapses to that single entry and
/// reads as "there is nothing else to pick".</para>

/// entirely while the list is being browsed. These pin what the filter does once somebody actually types,
