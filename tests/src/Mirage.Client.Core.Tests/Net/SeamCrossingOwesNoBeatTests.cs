/// <summary>
/// 🔴 Only a BLOCKING map load charges the arrival beat. A seamless crossing must not.
///
/// <para>The two meet in one place. A crossing asks the server for a region re-sync, and that carries the
/// new centre map's NPC snapshot — the very packet that ends a blocking load. Charging the beat there
/// stalls the player at every seam.</para>
///
/// <para><b>How long the stall is decides whether anyone sees it</b>, which is why this is worth a test
/// rather than an eye. A walk is 400 ms a tile, so a 200 ms beat disappears inside the step the player is
/// already taking. A sprint is nearer 138 ms, so the beat is LONGER than a step and the player visibly
/// stops at the border. The bug is invisible at the pace most testing happens at.</para>
