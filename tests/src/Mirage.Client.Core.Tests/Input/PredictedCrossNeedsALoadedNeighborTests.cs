/// <summary>
/// 🔴 A step off a map edge is predicted on the spot: the grid shifts and the cell in that direction
/// BECOMES the center map. So it may only be predicted into a cell that is actually loaded — an empty
/// one makes <see cref="ClientState.Map"/> null, and it is typed as though that cannot happen. Every
/// draw path dereferences it unchecked, so the next frame throws out of the draw loop, which on a
/// released client is a window that vanishes with nothing written down.
///
/// <para><b>A WARP is what makes this reachable, and warps are why it looks unrelated to edges.</b> A
/// warp empties the whole 3×3 grid and the server refills it a packet at a time, so for a few frames
/// the center map names neighbors that are not there yet. Land on a tile that is ALSO on an edge — the
/// ordinary shape of a doorway, where the tile you arrive on is the bottom row of the map outside —
/// with the movement key still held from walking into the door, and the step out is predicted into a
/// cell that is still empty.</para>
///
/// <para>Whether it lands is a race between a held key and the map packets, which is why it can be
/// reliable on one machine and unreproducible on another.</para>
///
/// <para>The server's confirmed cross carries the same rule already (it falls back to a blocking
/// reload rather than shifting an empty cell in). These two are the only places the center map changes
/// by shifting, and they now ask the same question of the same cell.</para>
