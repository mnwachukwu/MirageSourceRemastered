/// The mask is a signed distance field, and this is why.

/// <para>A mask of 0s and 1s sampled with LINEAR filtering ramps from lit to dark across the gap between two
/// texel CENTRES — four world pixels, centred on the boundary, so half of it lands on the art itself and
/// every silhouette wears a hairline of light. Shifting the mask cannot fix that: the artifact is a spread
/// around the boundary, not an offset from it, and a texel is the smallest thing you can shift by.</para>
///
/// <para>Interpolating a DISTANCE is different. The blend of two distances is still very nearly the distance,
/// so the shader thresholds it and lands the edge on the boundary to a fraction of a texel. What has to hold
/// for that to work is checked here: the encoding is centred on the edge, the field crosses it exactly at the
/// boundary between a lit texel and a dark one, and the halfway sample of that pair reads as the edge.</para>
