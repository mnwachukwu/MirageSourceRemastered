/// is decided by microseconds rather than by design.</para>

/// <para>Left alone, that cost every mob a third of its attacks: two ticks is 1000 ms, a strict comparison
/// rejects it, and the swing lands on the third tick at 1500 ms. These pin the beat at two ticks and pin it
/// against a tick arriving slightly early or slightly late, which is what made the NPC-vs-NPC path flip
/// between the two depending on how much work the tick had already done.</para>
