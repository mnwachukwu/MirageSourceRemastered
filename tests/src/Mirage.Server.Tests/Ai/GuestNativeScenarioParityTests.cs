// GUEST ↔ NATIVE SCENARIO PARITY (runtime layer).
//
// The structural suite (GuestNativeNpcParityTests) proves a guest IS a native record at the data level.
// This one goes further: it stands up a REAL NpcAiSystem (real CombatSystem + MovementSystem + BloodSystem,
// only the packet dispatcher stubbed to a no-op — the heavy sub-systems a chase STEP never touches are left
// null), places a native and an equivalent guest in the SAME situation in separate fresh worlds, runs the
// actual fast movement pass, and asserts the resulting movement is bit-identical. This is the end-to-end
// guard for the ### 7 class of bug (a code path that stepped natives but not guests, or at a different pace).
