/// The one place in the engine that divides currency.

/// <para>Splitting a gold drop across everyone who earned it replaced tagging the whole purse to a
/// single roll winner, and the arithmetic is the part with edges: gold is integral, so a party that
/// does not divide evenly has to either lose a coin or invent one, and a purse smaller than the
/// party has to not round everybody to nothing.</para>
///
/// <para>WHO gets a larger share is decided by a roll at the call site and is deliberately not this
/// function's business — which is exactly what leaves the arithmetic deterministic and testable.
/// These tests pin the shape of the split; they say nothing about the draw.</para>
