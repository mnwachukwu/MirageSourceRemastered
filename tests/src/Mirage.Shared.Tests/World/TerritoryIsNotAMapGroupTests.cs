/// A map group and a territory are two things, and the whole of the link between them is that a territory
/// IS the maps of its group.
///
/// <para>The group is authored: it travels inside a world folder, the editor writes it, and a world handed
/// to somebody else arrives with it. What a running server made of that group — an owner, income, a
/// war-night queue — belongs to one installation and lives in the data folder instead. Put any of it back
/// on the group and an authoring save starts overwriting who holds a territory, and a copied world starts
/// carrying somebody else's war.</para>
///
/// <para>These are convention tests because nothing else would notice: adding a property compiles, and the
/// damage only shows up on a world somebody sent to a friend.</para>
