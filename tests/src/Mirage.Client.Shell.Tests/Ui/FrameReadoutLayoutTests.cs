/// <para>🔴 It starts AT the bar and slides left only as far as the screen edge demands. The chat log fills
/// the other half of the screen, so a block that moves further than it has to lands on top of it — which is
/// what aligning its right edge to the BAR's right edge does, since every line is wider than four hotkeys.
/// The screen edge is the constraint; the bar is only where it starts.</para>
