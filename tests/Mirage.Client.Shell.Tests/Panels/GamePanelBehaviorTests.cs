/// The <see cref="IGamePanel"/> contract exercised BEHAVIORALLY on every registry panel, not just
/// checked for declaration (see GamePanelContractTests for that half).
///
/// <para>GameplayScreen's panel plumbing calls these four members generically now — z-order, focus,
/// hit-testing and bounds persistence all go through the interface rather than through a switch per
/// operation. That only works if every panel honors the same contract, and the two properties the
/// plumbing leans on hardest are: a CLOSED panel must not claim the pointer (or it would swallow world
/// clicks while invisible), and <c>SetBounds</c> must round-trip through <c>Bounds</c> (or a panel's
/// saved position would silently fail to restore).</para>
///
/// <para>Panels are constructed directly — no graphics device is required for these members, which is
/// what makes this reachable at all. Panels needing a constructor argument are excluded and named.</para>
