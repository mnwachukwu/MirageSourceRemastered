/// Guards the push-changes prompt (the unsaved-edits dialog raised on connect / reconnect / disconnect /
/// close) against silently pushing a THINNER record than an ordinary save would.
/// <para>A second, inline copy of the packet-building is the hazard: any field it misses is one the
/// per-type editor writes and the packet carries correctly, so the loss is invisible until an author
/// reopens the record. The dialog therefore sends exactly <c>row.BuildSavePacket()</c>, and pinning that
/// one projection pins the push too. Each fixture below fills EVERY field with a value distinguishable
/// from the default, so a field left unassigned in a future edit of the mapping fails here rather than
/// reaching a server.</para>
