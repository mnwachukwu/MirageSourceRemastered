/// <para>The round-trip tests here are the load-bearing ones. Before the UI existed the view model carried
/// the sales list through load and save as an untouched <c>List&lt;int&gt;</c>, precisely so a shop stocked
/// by the content generator could survive being opened in an editor that could not show it. Now that rows
/// exist, that guarantee has to be re-earned through a collection that empties, rebuilds and renumbers —
/// and a shopfront quietly lost on save looks exactly like a successful save.</para>
///
/// <para>Order is a real property, not presentation: <c>ShopRecord.Normalize</c> deliberately preserves it
/// because it is the order the player sees, which is what makes reordering worth authoring at all.</para>
