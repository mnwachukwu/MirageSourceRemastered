/// <para>The combat timer is refreshed by FIGHTING. One behavior also refreshes it by merely
/// CHASING, and that one never lets go: while the clock keeps being pushed forward it can never

/// <c>IsRelentlessPursuit</c> the real retention rule — the target drop on expiry is only its
/// consequence — and it is worth pinning on its own, because reading the drop code alone tells you
/// the opposite of what happens.</para>

/// <para>A guard is the only relentless pursuer, and only against a criminal. Everything else,
/// hostile mobs included, gives up on the same clock: break contact for the combat window and the
/// chase is over, whatever attacked you.</para>

/// <para>The method is private and the assembly has no InternalsVisibleTo, so it is invoked by
