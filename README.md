## Overview

This is a C# reimplementation (a remastering, if you will) of [Mirage Online v3.0.3](https://github.com/mnwachukwu/mirage-source-v3.0.3) — whose [original site](https://miragesource.net/) is still standing — a 2D tile-based MMORPG engine originally written in Visual Basic 6. The original's mechanics, formulas, and systems are the foundation, but combat, progression, and the economy have been substantially reworked and rebalanced (see [Changes from the VB6 original](docs/changes-from-vb6.md)) — so this is better described as *inspired by* Mirage Online than a faithful reproduction of it. It's a handwritten .NET 10 codebase built on [MonoGame](https://monogame.net/), [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/), and [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) — no VB6 runtime, no transpilation, no auto-conversion tools. The client's game logic carries no MonoGame dependency, so another shell such as [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) could consume `Mirage.Client.Core` unchanged; MonoGame is the shell shipped here.

I don't know why I did this.

## Project Structure

VB6 kept its source in `client/` and `server/`, with the editor forms — `frmItemEditor`, `frmNpcEditor`,
`frmShopEditor`, `frmSpellEditor` — sitting among the client's. The rewrite has four source folders,
because the two it adds are the parts VB6 had nowhere to put: code both sides must agree on, and the
editor.

| VB6 | C# | |
|---|---|---|
| `server/` | `server/src/` | `Mirage.Server.Core` — game logic, no transport dependency |
| | | `Mirage.Server.Host` — TCP, DI, entry point; runs headless |
| | | `Mirage.Server.Shell` — optional Avalonia front end for the same server |
| `client/` | `client/src/` | `Mirage.Client.Core` — game state and logic, no MonoGame dependency |
| | | `Mirage.Client.Shell` — MonoGame rendering, input and audio |
| `client/` (editor forms) | `editor/src/` | `Mirage.Editor` — Avalonia editor, offline against a world folder or live against a running server |
| — | `shared/src/` | `Mirage.Shared` — protocol types, records, and the formulas both sides evaluate |
| | | `Mirage.Ui` — the theme and shared controls the two Avalonia apps use |
| | | `Mirage.Updates` — the GitHub update check every app runs |

`Mirage.Shared` is referenced by all three solutions, replacing VB6's duplicated `modTypes.bas` definitions and the server/client divergence they caused. Every formula that both the client and the server must agree on — damage, requirements, prices, vitals — lives there and is evaluated from the same code on both sides.

`server/`, `client/` and `editor/` each carry a satellite `.slnx` for working on one area alone. The rest
of the tree is not source: `tests/` holds the suites in `src/` and their drivers above, `publish/` holds
the packaging drivers, and `assets/`, `docs/`, `tools/` and `.github/checks/` hold what is neither.

The root `Mirage.slnx` ties all twenty-four projects together, and the split is lopsided on purpose: **nine of the twenty-four are the game. The other fifteen exist to test and publish those nine.**

| | Count | What |
|---|---|---|
| **The game** | 3 | shared libraries — `Mirage.Shared`, `Mirage.Ui`, `Mirage.Updates` |
| | 3 | server — `Mirage.Server.Core`, `.Host`, `.Shell` |
| | 2 | client — `Mirage.Client.Core`, `.Shell` |
| | 1 | editor — `Mirage.Editor` |
| **Scaffolding** | 6 | test suites, one per source portion, in `tests/src/` |
| | 5 | test drivers in `tests/` — one per area, plus a root that runs all six suites |
| | 4 | publish drivers in `publish/` — one per deliverable, plus a root that runs all three |

Only the first nine compile into anything a player or a developer runs; a fork that never publishes and never runs the six test suites needs none of the other fifteen.

The suites split the way the code does: a **core** and a **shell** get separate suites wherever the shell can be swapped. `Mirage.Client.Core` carries no MonoGame and `Mirage.Server.Core` no Avalonia, and neither points back at a shell — the renderer and the management window are both replaceable, and separate suites are what keeps that so. A core suite builds without a shell on its reference path, so logic that reached for one would fail to compile rather than quietly tie the core to one front end.

**The two sides are not named symmetrically.** The client spells out both halves — `Mirage.Client.Core.Tests` and `Mirage.Client.Shell.Tests`. The server names only the shell, `Mirage.Server.Shell.Tests`, and leaves a bare `Mirage.Server.Tests` covering `Mirage.Server.Core` and `Mirage.Server.Host` together. There is no `Mirage.Server.Core.Tests` to find. Everything under `shared/` has its own suite, `Mirage.Shared.Tests`. See [Testing](docs/testing.md).

Some things people expect to find here live **outside** this repository, because they write into it
rather than build with it: the content generators that produced the seed, the scripts that draw the
app icons and control-scheme images, and the converter that imports an old VB6 world. Those are
published separately — see [Authoring tools](#authoring-tools) below.

The standalone balance simulators are not published. They answer "what would this feel like" against
the shipped formulas, nothing here builds or ships them, and their output is a judgment call that
already lives in the numbers.

Deliberately described rather than enumerated: a previous version of this section named three simulators
by hand and was wrong about all of it within a few months.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisite:** [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (10.x or later)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mnwachukwu/MirageSourceRemastered.git
cd MirageSourceRemastered
dotnet tool restore
dotnet tool restore --tool-manifest client/.config/dotnet-tools.json
```

There are two tool manifests, and the second command is not redundant: the root one declares `vpk`
(Velopack, used by the publish targets) and `ilspycmd`, while `client/.config/dotnet-tools.json`
declares `mgcb` (the MonoGame content builder). The client manifest sets `"isRoot": true`, which stops
the upward search, so a plain `dotnet tool restore` at the root never reaches it.

Run the server, then the client (and optionally the editor) in separate terminals:
```sh
dotnet run --project server/src/Mirage.Server.Host
dotnet run --project client/src/Mirage.Client.Shell
dotnet run --project editor/src/Mirage.Editor
```

The editor opens on nothing and says so. A world is a folder, and it edits one wherever it lives — so
either **World → Open World…** and point it at a world of your own or at
`server/src/Mirage.Server.Host/world/`, or connect to a running server and edit that world live. Running
from source there is no bundled copy, so the first Open is yours to aim.

> **Installed, both the server and the editor ship the world as `seed-world/` beside their executable**, and it
> is the same set of files and folders in each — whichever you installed, you already have it, and there is
> no reason to install one to get the other's copy. A much smaller `seed-data/` rides along with the
> defaults an installation starts with rather than a world, which today is the MOTD.
>
> **Neither is shipped as the folder it becomes**, so nothing an installer or an update writes can land on
> top of a world you already have. A first run lays each down only where there is nothing: no `world/` gets
> the shipped world, no `data/` gets the shipped defaults. An **empty** one of either is left exactly as
> found — that is somebody's blank canvas, and refilling it on the next launch is the one thing seeding must
> never do.
>
> So a fresh install starts on the shipped world without being asked, and clearing `world/` and restarting
> gets it back. To start from nothing instead, leave an empty `world/` in place. The editor needs no copy
> at all: it opens a world wherever it lives, and starts its picker at `seed-world/`.

> **Importing VB6 world data:** [MirageSourceRemasteredConverter](https://github.com/mnwachukwu/MirageSourceRemastered.Tools.Public) turns an original VB6 server directory into this JSON format in one pass — all binary `.dat` maps and INI data files, with account passwords hashed on the way through and the source files never modified, so a run costs nothing if the result is not what you wanted. See [Authoring tools](#authoring-tools).

> **`world.json`** at a world folder's root is what the folder says about itself: its **name**, the **size new maps are created at**, and its record ceilings. Set them in the editor under **World → World Settings**. The file is optional — a folder without one runs on the stock answers.
>
> **The world name and the game name are different things, and only one of them is public.** The *game* name is what a player sees — the window title, the login screen, the chat greeting. The *world* name identifies one set of records, and exists so an operator can tell a live world from a test copy of it in the editor's title bar, the server window and the logs. **It never reaches a player**, so there is no reason to make it presentable and no harm in calling a folder "friday-rollback-test".
>
> **Map size.** A map is 16×12 tiles unless it says otherwise; `world.json` sets what a *new* map starts at, and any map can be resized in its properties. Maps joined by an edge must all be the same size — world coordinates run continuously across a seam, so a mismatch would make a step across one land somewhere other than where it looks — and the editor refuses to resize a linked map rather than letting that happen. **Resizing cannot be undone**: shrinking discards the tiles outside the new bounds and nothing writes them anywhere first, so the editor itemizes exactly what would go and tells you to copy the folder first.
>
> Past 128 tiles on an axis the editor warns, but nothing breaks. Drawing the world costs the same at every size — the client only ever draws what fits on screen — so what grows with a map is the two things that read it whole: crossing a seam loads three maps, and an NPC that loses its path searches the whole nine-map neighbourhood before giving up. At 128×128 each takes about 40 ms, a few frames and under a tenth of an AI tick; at 256×256 both are about 180 ms, which is a visible stall. Resident memory is 96 bytes a tile, so 1.5 MB for a 128×128 map against 18 KB for the default. The actual ceiling is 65,535 on either axis, which is how wide a warp's destination coordinate is: past that, a map could hold tiles no door could point at.

> **A server runs on two folders, and the split is one question: does it change while the server runs?**
>
> `world/` is what an author wrote — maps, items, NPCs, spells, shops, quests, conversations, classes and `world.json`. Nothing in it changes unless somebody edits it, which is what lets a world be zipped up and handed to another machine. It is the folder the **editor** opens.
>
> `data/` is what one installation accumulated — accounts, guilds, market listings, trade journals, seasons, dropped items, the name registry, the ban lists, the clock and the MOTD. It belongs to that server on that machine and means nothing beside a different world. Keeping the two apart is what stops a copied world carrying somebody's password hashes with it.
>
> Both default to sitting beside the executable and are set independently, `WorldDir` and `DataDir`.
>
> **Seed data:** `server/src/Mirage.Server.Host/world/` is the shipped default configuration — 10 classes, 558 items, 270 spells, 177 NPCs, 38 conversations, 54 quests and 21 shops. Any collection you leave out is created empty and written on first save, so a partial world folder boots fine.
>
> Those counts are checked against the folder by `.github/checks/check-seed-counts.mjs`, which CI runs — they have gone stale twice.
>
> **There are no maps in it, and that is the important caveat.** The seed is a content *library*, not a world: it defines what exists — the items, the bestiary, the townsfolk, the shops they keep and the quests they give — but nothing places any of it on a tile. Start a server against this `data/` and you get the 177 NPCs as definitions and a set of blank maps with none of them standing anywhere. Placing them is map authoring, which is what the editor is for.
>
> **The seed is TEST data, not a game.** It was built to exercise the engine at three specific bands — **levels 1–20, 100–120, and 235–255** — and there is deliberately *nothing in between*. Levels 21–99 and 121–234 have no mobs, no gear and no spells at all: a character leveling normally runs out of world twice. The three bands exist so combat, gearing and party scaling could be measured at the bottom, middle and top of the curve without authoring 255 levels of content to get there.
>
> It is included as a courtesy — enough to start a server and see the systems work, and a worked example of what the record formats look like — but it is not a playable game and was never intended as one. It is regular enough to look machine-written because it is: the generators that wrote it are published, so the seed can be regenerated, retuned, or replaced wholesale rather than treated as fixed. See [Authoring tools](#authoring-tools). Placing any of it on a map is still the editor's job.

## Authoring tools

The seed world in `data/` was not hand-authored. It was generated, and the generators that wrote it are
published: **[MirageSourceRemastered.Tools.Public](https://github.com/mnwachukwu/MirageSourceRemastered.Tools.Public)**.

They are there because a seed you cannot regenerate is a seed you can only edit. With them you can retune
the whole economy, rescale the bestiary, or throw the shipped content away and generate your own to the
same shape.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`ContentGenerators/`** | The ten that wrote the seed — spellbook, armory, bestiary, classes, conversations, quests, shops. `run-all.cs` runs them in the order they depend on each other and stops at the first failure. |
| **`ArtGenerators/`** | The app icons and the in-game control-scheme reference images, drawn as geometry rather than exported from a design file. |
| **`MirageSourceRemasteredConverter/`** | Imports an original VB6 Mirage Online server directory into this JSON format — binary `.dat` maps and INI data alike, with account passwords hashed on the way through. The source directory is only ever read. |

Two things worth knowing before running any of them:

- **They compute with this engine's own formulas.** Each one takes a project reference on
  `Mirage.Shared`, so item prices come from `EconomyFormulas`, NPC health from the same
  `GetNpcMaxHp` the server uses, and experience from `ExpFormulas`. A generator cannot drift from the
  engine, because it has no second copy of the rule to drift from. That is also why the tools repository
  expects to sit beside this one — the reference is a relative path.
- **They own their collections outright.** A generator clears its collection before writing, so hand
  edits to `data/items/` are lost the next time the armory generator runs. Author in the editor, or
  author in the generator — not both.

The pipeline reproduces the committed seed byte-identically, which makes `git status` on `data/` after a
run a real check that nothing has drifted.

Not published: the standalone balance simulators. They exist to answer design questions, their output is
already baked into the numbers the generators use, and nothing here builds them.

## Known limitation: the client has no name until a server gives it one

The client ships branded **Mirage Source Remastered** — the engine's name. It has no game identity of its
own, because one client is meant to reach every server. On connect, before you log in, the server tells it
the game's name, and the window title, the menu and the HUD show that from then on.

So launching "Mirage Source Remastered" and arriving in "Brightwater" is expected. It is a handshake, not
a rebrand and not a bait and switch: the engine cannot know what to call itself until a server says.

Two things deliberately do **not** follow the server's name:

- **Your settings folder.** It stays under the engine name, so joining a differently-named game never
  moves your configuration or loses your options.
- **The executables.** Server and client filenames are fixed, which is what lets the management window
  find the server it ships beside.

Operators set their game's name in the server window under **Configuration → This server → Game name**,
or as `gameName` in `serverconfig.json`. Leaving it empty keeps the engine's name.

If you want a client that carries your own name and icon from the moment it launches, that is a rebuild
rather than a setting — see [Icons and shipping your own client](docs/branding.md).
