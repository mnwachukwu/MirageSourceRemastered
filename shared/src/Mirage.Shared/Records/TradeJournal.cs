/// A durable write-ahead record of a direct-trade swap in flight — the commit point that makes the swap
/// atomic across the two participants' SEPARATE account files. Written (and fsync'd) BEFORE either character
/// is saved with the swap applied, and deleted only after BOTH are durably saved. If the server dies in
/// between, boot recovery (<c>TradeSystem.RecoverJournalsAsync</c>) replays it: for each side, if that
/// character's escrow (<see cref="PlayerRecord.TradeOffer"/>) is still non-empty the swap hadn't been applied
/// for them, so it grants their <c>Receives</c> and clears their escrow; an already-applied side (escrow
/// empty) is skipped. That idempotency — escrow-empty ⇔ this side already swapped, atomic within one account
/// file — closes the cross-file tearing window (no dupe, no loss) without a per-record applied-id log.

/// Server-internal (never sent to a client). <c>AReceives</c> = the items player A receives (B's staged
