/// localization guard test rejects any string carrying a codepoint the font can't render (it caught an em
/// dash in this very feature). Adding four codepoints to the font is a content change; four shapes drawn
/// from lines and a rect is a dozen lines of code that can never fall back to a blank box.</para>

/// <para>Detection is best-effort and deliberately conservative: MonoGame surfaces only a driver-supplied
/// display name, so this looks for Sony's well-known product strings and otherwise assumes Xbox, which is

/// the wrong alphabet, never the wrong button.</para>
