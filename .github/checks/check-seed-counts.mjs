// Check that the seed counts quoted in the README match what is actually in world/.
//
//     node tools/check-seed-counts.mjs
//
// Node rather than C#, for the same reason as check-doc-links.mjs beside it: every GitHub-hosted
// runner ships Node already, so this costs nothing, while a .NET file-based program would need a
// setup-dotnet step to check one sentence. No dependencies, no package.json.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The README's seed-data callout is the only place the size of the shipped world is
// written down in prose, and the site is written FROM this README by its own stated rule — so a wrong
// number here publishes in two places. It has gone stale twice: once when the armory grew to 558 items
// and the bestiary to 124, and again when the friendly NPCs took that to 174 and added conversations,
// quests and shops that the sentence did not mention at all.
//
// Nothing else would catch it. The counts are prose; no test reads them, nothing compiles them, and
// the person who adds 50 NPCs is the least likely to reread a paragraph in the getting-started
// section. That is exactly the shape of rot check-doc-links.mjs was written for, applied to numbers.
//
// AN EMPTY world/ IS A PASS, not a failure — the same rule SeedIntegrityTests uses. world/ is the
// shipped default configuration and is deliberately allowed to be empty; a fresh clone that has not
// populated it must not go red, or this check is the first thing anybody deletes.
