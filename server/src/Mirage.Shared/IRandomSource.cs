/// <para>The rolls behind this interface decide the things players argue about: whether a hit is
/// blocked or dodged, whether it crits, which stat a death drains, how much of a stack drops, who
/// wins a loot roll, whether an NPC casts or closes, which way it wanders or kites, where it spawns,
/// and how long mail spends in transit. Every one of those read <c>Random.Shared</c> directly at the
/// point of use, so a test could only sample the distribution — which is why the kite-bias suite is
/// a statistical test rather than a behavioural one. With the roll injected, a test can pin the
/// sequence and assert the outcome: this loot table with this roll yields this drop.</para>

/// <para>Only the members the server actually uses are exposed, deliberately: a narrow surface is
/// trivial to implement in a test double, whereas mirroring <see cref="Random"/> would not be.</para>
