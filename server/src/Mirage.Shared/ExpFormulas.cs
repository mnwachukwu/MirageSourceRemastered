    // TNL grows as `level^TnlExponent × TnlConstant`.  With a linear-stat-sum EXP curve and
    // stat budgets growing ~linearly with player level, kills/level scales as L^(TnlExponent − 1):
    //   1.5  → √L growth  (kills cap in the low hundreds at L=255 — pre-rebalance)
    //   2.0  → linear in L ("thousands at endgame")
    //   2.5  → L^1.5 growth (tens of thousands at endgame; brutal grind)
    // L=1 always costs exactly TnlConstant because 1^anything = 1 — so low-level pacing is
    // unaffected by bumping the EXPONENT; only mid-late game gets the "modern MMO" grind shape.
    //
    // THE TWO KNOBS DO DIFFERENT JOBS and it is easy to reach for the wrong one.  The exponent
    // BENDS the curve — it changes how the road is distributed across levels.  The constant SCALES
    // it: TNL is linear in TnlConstant, so kills/level and total wall-clock scale with it exactly
    // and nothing else moves.  Time-to-kill, the share of the road below level 127, and "reaching
    // 100 is ~6% of the way to 255" are all identical at any constant.  So the constant is the
    // right knob for wall-clock — and mob stats are NOT, because they also feed ExpForKill and
    // expected TTK and would move three things while you were aiming at one.
    //
    // 950 → 500, 2026-08-13.  Level-matching the bestiary (mobs had been running 2.4–3.85× over
    // their label) cut each kill's reward harder than it cut the kill's duration, so the road to
    // 255 nearly doubled — 3,713h → 7,106h of pure killing — without any fight getting longer.
    // 500 restores the settled wall-clock (3,741h, within 1%) and keeps the shorter fights.

    //     one-shot yields ~1 → tiny EXP: no farming trivial mobs, and no separate "gap tier" is needed.

    //     rewarded, but only as threat-to-YOU (a mob far below you is no threat → no bonus), so you can't farm safe
    //     mobs OR trivial ones.  A dangerous glass cannon pays the premium; it can also kill you, so it's earned.
