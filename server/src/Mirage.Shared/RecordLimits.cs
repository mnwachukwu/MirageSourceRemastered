/// How many of each record family a server has room for.

/// <para><b>These are per-server, not protocol-wide.</b> Nothing on the wire constrains them — the protocol
/// is JSON, so a record number is a number of whatever width the field declares. A server sizes its own
/// tables from this, states it in the pre-login hello, and the client sizes to match. That is the whole
/// reason it exists: <c>Constants.Max*</c> is <c>const</c>, so a client compiled against 1000 items would
/// REJECT item 1200 as out of range on a server that authored it.</para>
///
/// <para>The defaults are the values that used to be the constants, so an operator who configures nothing
/// gets exactly what they had before. Raising costs three things, all local and known: the server pads
/// each family to its ceiling in the RUNTIME data folder on first launch, <c>GameWorld</c> allocates one
/// array per family, and the editor's slot pickers list that many rows.</para>
///
/// <para>Not every ceiling belongs here. The per-character shapes — inventory, bank, hotkeys, spellbook,
/// character slots — are baked into the save format, so changing one is a data migration rather than a
/// setting, and they stay <c>const</c>.</para>
